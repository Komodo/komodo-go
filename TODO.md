# Immediate TODOs

- Upload to Komodo addons site <http://community.activestate.com/addons>
- Screenshot in readme.
- Icon for the extension.


# Longer term projects

- Lots to finish in syntax highlighting from <http://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html>
  The original state (still current?) is almost a straight copy of Maya's UDL.
- Add tools: compiling go code, compile and run
- Add a Go prefs panel to assist with setting up env for using Go?
- Hook `gofmt` up to Komodo IDE's code formatting.
- Add section regexes to Komodo IDE's sections list.
- Use <http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/> to build a stdlib API catalog for Go.
